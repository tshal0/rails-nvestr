Description: Idea log for my stream of consciousness. 
Created by: Thomas Shallenberger 1/21/2017


Should be timestamped I guess. 

User registration/login implemented. Error handling in place. 

TODO: Actual site/database design. 

Design conventions to keep in mind:

Database and model associations set up FIRST

Test driven and behavior driven development

	TDD: Design tests first, then the feature. 
	BDD: Same as TDD, but from a user story perspective. 
		Where to start in the process
		What and what not to test
		How much to test in one go
		What to call the tests

	User Stories:

		Title
		Narrative
			Who is the driver (beneficiary of the story)
			What effects the story has
			What biz value the stakeholder will get from the effect
		Acceptance criteria/Scenarios
			For each case of the narrative:
				Specify initial condition
				What is the event trigger for scenario
				Expected outcome


Apparently rails handles relationships

user (done needs updating)

stock
	stock_id, name, price, symbol
role
	role_id, name

portfolio
	portfolio_id
	user_id
